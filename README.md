# Calculator
This is my first proyect using html css and js. The idea was to implement an old calculator wich only used javascript, and create a new one.

This calculator accepts keyboard and mouse input.
0-9: numerical input
-, +, /, *, . : both on keyboard and mouse
square Root and square only with mouse
Enter to validate/calculate
backspace to delete last input
Delete to clear the calculator

Built with
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
